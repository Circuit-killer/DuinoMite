##How to upload these files##

You need a PIC32-compatible programmer tool to upload any of the hexes in this directory. If you lack such you can try to recover your DUINOMITE board with the DM basic files located in the HID-BOOTLODER directory.

##Which files are suitalbe for my board?##

If you have DUINOMITE or DUINOMITE-MINI or DUINOMITE-MEGA get either DuinoMite-Mega-Mini_Bootloader+DMBasic.hex or DuinoMite-Mega-Mini_ONLY_DMBasic.hex.

If you have DUINOMITE EMEGA then get either DuinoMite-eMega_Bootloader+DMBasic.hex or DuinoMite-eMega_ONLY_Bootloader.hex.
